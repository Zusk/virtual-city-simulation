This project is a simple web-based simulation of a virtual "city" populated by agents, each with randomly generated sci-fi names and assigned tasks. Each agent performs a job for a random duration, such as "Studying" or "Working," and updates their status in real time. The app features a terminal-style interface where users can scroll through agents, view their current task, and see how long the agent will continue their job.
